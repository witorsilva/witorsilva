### Hello, I'm Witor Silva Oliveira or just Witor, I'm a Software Developer from Brazil!

#### Who am I

All my life was based on tecnology, i like discover new things on all the web, and listen to Rock and Roll :heart: When I was a kid I love liked to use the computers. My first contact with development was with my uncles(developers), I developed my first website using the basics of HTML and CSS and since then I'm a person who loves to build something on the web.
